# WTP CS Problem Set 1

To get started, go to www.edmodo.com. Click "Join a group" and use the class code `rb6z2a`. You should see "R'mani Haulcy's Class". Create a new student account, look at the latest posts, find the post for Problem Set 1, and download the files.
 
### 1. Writing your first program - `hello.py`

Write a program that will print “Hello, <your_name>!!!” in a box like this: 

```
##########################
#                        #
# Greetings, Brittney!!! #
#                        #
##########################
```

*Hint: You will need to use more than one `print` command.*

You should put each command on a new line. 

### 2.  Adding comments 
At the beginning, your programs will be small and easy to understand. Over time, they’ll get bigger and more complicated. Instead of having to understand what every line of code does, you can add comments to your code that explain what you were trying to do. 
 
You can add a comment using the # sign: 

``` python
# Print a message to the screen 
print "hello, wtp!"
```
Comments are ignored by the computer – you can write anything you want there. 
Best practice, and what we would like you to do in this class, is to write code that explains 
what your program does and what you want it to do. For example, if you were writing a game 
like rock-paper-scissors, but you didn’t know where to start, you could write this: 
```python
# First player picks one of rock, paper, or scissors 
# Second player picks one of rock, paper, or scissors 
# If first player beats second player, print a winning screen for her 
# If second player beats first player, print a winning screen for her 
```

### 3. Doing math - `calculator.py`
We can also use Python as a calculator. The basic operations are: 
 
> \+ Addition 
>
> \- Subtraction 
>
> \* Multiplication 
>
>\/ Division 
>
>\** Exponentiation 
 
Let’s use Python to solve the following problem: 
 
If you run a 5K race in 20 minutes 30 seconds, what is your **average time (minutes) per mile**? What is your **average speed in miles per hour**? *Hint: There are 1.61 kilometers in a mile.* In your program, store useful values in variables, and print your final answers!

For this part of the problem set, we want to add comments to the hello.py file that we just wrote. 
Now, *edit the program from the previous exercise and add a comment at the beginning of the file with 
the filename, your name, anyone you worked with (no one if it’s no one), and a sentence about what it does*. 
You should do that for all future programs. 

### 4. String operators - `stringop.py`
String operators are less intuitive than those on numbers. Given the following variables, what are the values of these expressions? (Try getting the answer on your own and use Sublime only to check your answer.)

```
# Variables
look = "Look at me!" 
now = " NOW"

# Expressions
look[:4] 
 
look[-1] 
 
look*2 
 
look[:-1] + now + look[-1]
 
now[1]
 
now[4]
 
look*2 + look[:-1] + now + look[-1] 
```

### 5. Greetings - `greetings.py`
Print  a  greeting  saying  **“Hello,  Michelle"** and  **“Goodbye,  Obama"**  using  only  the  variables  provided  in `greetings.py`.  Complete instructions are in the file.
 
### 6. Optional Challenge:
Revisit Question 1, and write a program that prints **“Hello \<name>!!!”** in a box of stars for ANY name.

*Hint: Find the length of a string with  len(a_string)*

### Submitting your PSET
After you’ve finished your PSET, log into your Edmodo account, find the post for Problem Set 1, click "Open Assignment", attach all of the files that you created or edited for Problem Set 1, and then click "Turn in Assignment". You can resubmit the assignment as many times as you'd like. After you turn in your assignment, you're all done!
