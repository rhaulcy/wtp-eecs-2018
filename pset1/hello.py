# Welcome to your first Python program! 
# Lets print in Sublime 
 
print("Hello, World!")
 
# TODO: Update instructions on how to run stuff in Sublime
# In IDLE, go to Run -> Run Module (or fn F5 for a short cut!)
# You haven't made any changes yet,
#     but you must always save before running your program.
# You should see "Hello, World!"" in your shell.
 
# Write a program that will print "Hello, <your name>!!!"
# in a box like the one below
 
# **************************
# *                        *
# * Hello, Harry Potter!!! *
# *                        *
# **************************
 
# Hint: Look at the Concatenation slide from lecture!  

# Challenge:
# Write a program that will print "Hello, <name>!!!" in a box of stars for ANY name!
# Hint, find the length of a string with len(a_string)
