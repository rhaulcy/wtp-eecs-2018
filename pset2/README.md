# WTP CS Problem Set 2

To get started, log into your Edmodo student account, find the post for Problem Set 2, and download the files.
 
### 1. print vs return - `print_vs_return.py`

Open the template file `print_vs_return.py`. In it, these two functions are defined: 

```python
def f1(x):
    print x + 1

def f2(x):
    return x + 1
```

Run this code. We will now go through some examples using these functions. Answer all the bolded questions by commenting in `print_vs_return.py`.

**What happens when we call the functions below? (Try getting the answer on your own and use IDLE only to check your answer).**

Example 1:
```python
>>> f1(3)
?
>>> f2(3)
?
```

From example 1, it looks like they behave in exactly the same way, but they really don't.

Example 2: Try this:
```python
>>> a = f1(3)
>>> b = f2(3)
>>> a
?
>>> b
?
```
**What are the values of a and b? Why are they different?**

Example 3: Now run the following code:
```python
>>> print f1(3)
?
?
>>> print f2(3)
?
```
**What is the output? Why are you getting this output?**

Example 4:
```python
>>> f1(3) + 1
? 
?
?
?
>>> f2(3) + 1
?
```
**What is the output? Why are you getting this output? What do all of these examples tell us about when we want to return and when we want to print? (When is printing useful? When is returning useful?)**

Note: You might find it useful to explicitly `return None` when you don't want your function to return anything. This way, you'll always remember that what Python is *actually* doing is returning `None` if you don't tell it to return anything.

### 2.  Making desserts with Python - `desserts.py`
Use the provided code to "make" desserts with Python.

**Hint:** Remember the differences between `return` and `print`. Do we want our functions to return or print in this problem?

(a) We’ve  given  you  a  very  basic  recipe  for  tiramisu  –  you  combine  ladyfingers,  mascarpone  cream,  and espresso  syrup.  However,  it  just  comes  out  in  one  big  chunk.  We  need  you  to  be  organized  chefs  and make  a  separate  function  for  each  of  the  parts.

Make  separate  functions  for  ladyfingers,  mascarpone  cream,  and  espresso  syrup.  The  functions should  print  out  the  individual  recipes  for  each  of  those  parts.  Make  a  function  for  tiramisu  that calls  each  of  the  functions  of  its  component  parts.  When  you  run  it,  it  should  output  the  same  thing as  the  original  program  did,  but  be  much  more  organized  in  the  code!

(b) Now  you  should  make  a  new  function  that  prints  out  a  nice  border,  something  like  this: __________----------**********oooooOOOOOooooo**********----------__________ or  this: <><><><><><><><><>[][][][][][][][]<><><><><><><><><> Print  the  border  out,  using  the  function  you  just  created,  at  the  beginning  of  the  recipe,  after  the title,  and  at  the  end.

(c) You’re  a  very  innovative  chef  and  have  come  up  with  a  new  recipe  –  ladyfinger  parfaits.  This  recipe is  one part  ladyfingers,  which  you  already  have  a  recipe  for,  and  one  part  parfait  cream.

Copy  the  parfait  cream  recipe  from `parfaitcream.txt` and  paste  it  into `desserts.py`.  (You  can highlight  the  text  with  your  mouse,  then  copy  and  paste.)  Then  edit  your  code  to  make  a  new function  that  prints  out  the  recipe,  like  you  did  for  the  ladyfingers  recipe  above.  Then  make  a  new function  for  your  combined  ladyfinger  parfaits  recipe,  too  –  using  the  ladyfinger  function  and  parfait cream  function.

Print  all  of  the  recipes  now,  with  your  border  before  the  titles,  after  the  titles,  and  after  the  text  of the  recipe.

### 3. Mystery program - `mystery.py`
Do not run this program. Just look at it and determine outputs. Look at this code fragment and trace what's happening. Find out what the final outcome is and *show your work* by creating a file called `mystery.py` and commenting in it.
 
```python
def  b(z):
     prod  =  a(z,  z)
     print  z,  prod
     return  prod
     
def  a(x,  y):
     x=x+1
     prod  =  x  *  y
     return  prod
     
def  c(x,  y,  z):
     sum  =  x  +  y  +  z
     pow  =  b(sum)  **  2
     return  pow
     
x = 1
y = x + 1
res = c(x,  y+3,  x+y)
print res
```

Once you are done, you can run the code to verify that your answer is correct.

### 4. Not equal - `not_equal.py`
Imagine  that  the `!=` operator  for  numbers  has  suddenly  been  removed  from  the  Python  programming language.  We  need  to  find  a  way  to  replace  it  with  the  remaining  operators  in  the  language.  Remember that  before  it  went  missing,  the `!=` operator  took  two  numbers,  and  returned `True` if  they  were  not  equal to  one  another,  and `False` otherwise.

Create a file called `not_equal.py` and write  a  function `not_equal`.  We  still  have  the `not` operator  (which  can  be  applied  to booleans)  and  the `==` operator,  which  can  be  applied  to  numbers. 

Now  let’s  try  and  test  our  new  function.  Create  4  variables `a`, `b`, `c`,  and `d`,  such  that `a` and `b` have the same  value,  and `c` and `d` are  different  from  one  another. 

Now  write  a  call  to  your `not_equal` function,  passing it `a` and `b`,  and  assign  its  return  value  to  a  variable `not_equal_test1`.  Then  print  out  the  value  of `a` and `b` and  the  value  that  was  returned  by  your  function `not_equal`.  This  tests  whether  your  function  does  the  right  thing  when  the  two  values  are  actually  equal. 

Now  test  that  your  function  works  when  the  parameters  are  not  equal  (by  passing  it `c` and `d`).  Assign  the return  value  to  a  variable `not_equal_test2`,  and  print  out  the  values.

Compare your output to the output below:
```python
>>> 5
>>> 5
>>> False
>>> 1
>>> 3
>>> True
```

Your output will be slightly different if you choose different values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

### 5. Simple graphics - `simple_graphics.py`
Let’s  make  a  simple  graphics  program.  Open `simple_graphics.py` in  IDLE,  but  don’t  run  it  yet!  You  can find  all  the  documentation  for  the  graphics  module  in the graphics reference sheet on Edmodo.  We  explain  the code in `simple_graphics.py` below.

***

**from  graphics  import  *

This  tells  us  that  we’re  going  to  use  graphics.  Importing  graphics  gives  us  access  to  all  sorts  of  graphics commands  that  someone  else  has  made  for  us.

**win  =  GraphWin('My  Circle',  100,  100)**
We’re  creating  a  new  graphics  window,  called `win` of  type `GraphWin` (part  of  the  graphics  module).  We’re calling  it `My  Circle` and  telling  it  to  have  dimensions  of  100 x 100  pixels.

**c  =  Circle(Point(50,  50),  10)**
We’re  creating  a  circle  called `c` with  a  center  point  at  (50,50)  and  with  a  radius  of  10.  Note  that  the center  of  the  circle  is  a  (unnamed) `Point` with  coordinates  (x,  y)  =  (50,50).

**c.setFill('red')**
We’re  coloring  the  circle  red.  This  can  take  most  normal  colors.  See  the  documentation  under *Generating Colors* for  more  information.

**c.draw(win)
win.mainloop()**
Now  that  we’ve  decided  on  attributes  for  the  circle  (position,  size,  and  color),  we’re  actually  drawing  it on  the  screen.

***

Now  run  the  code.  A  window  with  your  image  will  pop  up!

Feel  free  to  try  playing  around  with  some  of  the  values  –  see  where  things  break,  and  see  where  you  can change  things.  Then  change  the  code  to  do  the  following  things:

(a) Make  your  circle  bigger  -  specifically,  double  the  radius.

(b) Your  circle  is  currently  centered  in  your  window.  Change  your  code  so  that  the  circle  is  now  located in  the  upper  right  hand  corner  of  the  window.  Specifically,  the  center  of  the  circle  should  be  located in  the  middle  of  the  upper-right  quadrant  of  the  window.  (Hint:  coordinates  are  counted  from  the top-left  corner.  You  can  also  use  a  trial-and-error  approach  by  changing  the  numbers  for  the  circle until  you  get  what  you  want!)

(c) Make  the  circle  yellow.

(d) Make  the  outline  of  the  circle  purple.  (Hint:  you  will  need  to  look  up  how  to  do  this in the  online  graphics  documentation.  Remember  that  all  the  functions for  “Graphics  Objects”  can  be  used  for  any  shapes!)

(e) Then  submit  your  code.
 
### 6. Yummy graphics (optional) - `parfait_graphics.py` 
We  already  know  how  to  print  text  in  the  Python  shell,  but  sometimes  we  may  want  to  “draw”  text,  so that  we  can  decide  its  color,  size,  and  more.  The  code  in `parfait_graphics.py` is  an  example  of  how  to draw  text  on  the  screen.  Run  the  program  to  see  the  text  it  draws  in  the  window.

Now,  change  the  font  size,  style,  and  color  of  the  text.  (You  can  pick  whatever  you  like!)  Look  at  the `setSize`, `setStyle`, and `setTextColor` methods  in  the  documentation  under  Text  methods.  All  the `set` methods  that  change  the  attributes  of  the  graphics  object  automatically  update  its  appearance  on  the screen.

After  you’ve  played  around,  use  the  functions  you  wrote  in  exercise  2  in `desserts.py` to  “draw”  your recipe  for  ladyfinger  parfaits  on  the  screen.  (*Hint:  Change  the `print` statements  to  draw  text  on  the screen  instead.  You  will  need  to  choose  the  locations  to  “draw”  each  line  of  text!)*

Create  a  function  called `parfait_stamp` that  takes  in  an `x` and a `y` value  and  draws  a  ladyfinger  parfait centered  around  the  point  (x,  y)  on  the  screen.  (Don’t  worry:  we’re  not  grading  for  realism.)  Decorate your  recipe!
